awebshell - a library for quickly accessing web pages with short command line interface-style commands.

Written by Lee Bush.

Maintainer: David Monaghan <awebshell@allstruck.com>.

See __init__.py for more details.



EXAMPLE:
   There is a 'gim' command that does a Google Image search.
   'gim' coresponds to a Web Shell URL 'http://images.google.com/images?q=%s' in a Command Database.
   When the Web Shell URL is evaluated with the arguments 'baby penguins', the following final URL is
   evaluated:
     'http://images.google.com/images?q=baby+penguins'

   The code to perform this example would be:
     
     import awebshell
     
     from awebshell.database.CSVCommandDatabase import CSVCommandDatabase #select the CSV implementation of the command database protocol.
                                                                          #other database implementations are available.
     command_database = CSVCommandDatabase('<put the path to the CSV file here>/test_web_shell_command_database.csv')
     
     web_shell = WebShell(command_database)
     
     command = 'gim baby penguins'
     
     final_url, can_inline = web_shell.evaluate(command)
     
     print final_url #prints http://images.google.com/images?q=baby+penguins
     
     #(the can_inline variable can be ignored except for advanced use)
     
     #now, if you want to point your webbrowser to that webpage you could run...
     import webbrowser
     webbrowser.open(final_url) #pictures of cute little penguins appear in you web browswer. So cute!

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This library's functionality was inspired heavily by the 'yubnub' Ruby on Rails project.



PLATFORMS SUPPORTED:

This library is platform independent and should run fine on any platform.



LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION:

For now, just read the documentation in these files:
   ./__init__.py
   ./WebShell.py
   
...And look at the demo application source code:
   ./apps/awebshell_console_app.py



MAIN FOLDERS:

* 'tests/'  contains the test cases and test rig.

  You can run the tests using the following commands:
     cd ./tests/
     python ./run_test_cases.py



* 'apps/'  contains apps that demonstrate the library's functionality.

   You can run the demo program by running the following commands
     cd ./apps/
     python ./awebshell_console_app.py
   
   This will present you with an interactive interface:
   
   
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Welcome to the AWebShell Console.
     
     Type 'webbrowser=disabled' if you wish to disable browser control.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     > 

   You can now type in awebshell commands. For example:
   
    > gim baby penguins
    
   ...Will launch your web browser and run a Google Image search for pictures of baby penguins.
   How cute!
